# Imagae Classification Model With Pytorch

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying flowers using a pre-trained ResNet-18 model. The model is trained using **PyTorch** and **Torchvision** and can classify images into different flower categories.


## Project Overview
This project trains a deep learning model to classify flower images. It uses transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet-18 model. The model is trained and validated using image datasets.

## Requirements
The required libraries are:

PyTorch
Torchvision
Matplotlib


1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Train the model:

    ```bash
    python training.py
    ```
